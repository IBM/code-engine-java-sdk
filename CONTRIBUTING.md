## Commit Messages
Commit messages should follow the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).
This is because our release tool - [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) -
uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs.
Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
can be used to help contributors and enforce commit messages.
Here are some examples of acceptable commit messages, along with the release type that would be done based on the commit message:

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                              | Release type               |

  1. Fork the repository.
  2. Develop and test your code changes:
      * Follow the coding style as documented above
      * To build/test: `mvn test`
      * Please add one or more tests to validate your changes.
  3. Make sure everything builds/tests cleanly.
      * The build will run the code style checker and flag any issues.

  5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the **master** branch.
  6. Be sure to sign the CLA.

# Running Tests
By default, when you run `mvn test` only unit tests are run.   Integration tests are skipped
because they require credentials.

To run the integration tests, you need to provide credentials to the integration test framework, then
run `mvn test -DskipIT=false`.

To run the tests in a specific test class, use the `-Dtest` flag when invoking `mvn test`, e.g.:

```
mvn test -Dtest=SdkCommonTest
```

You can run a specific test by adding the name of the test method, e.g.:

```
mvn test -Dtest=SdkCommonTest#testGetSdkHeaders
```

# Code Coverage
This repo uses [Jacoco][jacoco] to measure code coverage. To obtain a code coverage report, run `mvn clean verify`
from the root of the project, and then view the coverage report in the `modules/coverage-reports/target` directory:
```
open modules/coverage-reports/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/index.html
```

# Generating Javadocs
To generate the Javadocs for the project, run `mvn site` and then view the docs in the `target/site/apidocs` directory:
```
open target/site/apidocs/index.html
```
